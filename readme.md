# LoraDrone Project

This project attempts to combine flight controller and RC receiver into one, using a number of integrated LoRa dev boards, like the ESP32 LoRa boards and the Adafruit Feather M0 LoRa.


## Credits

Thanks to these two projects for inspiration. I have combined the code from these two projects to form the start of this one:
