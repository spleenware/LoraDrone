# LoraDrone Project

This project attempts to combine flight controller and RC receiver into one, using a number of integrated LoRa dev boards, like the ESP32 LoRa boards and the Adafruit Feather M0 LoRa.

## Prototype

My prototype build is using an Adafruit Feather M0 LoRa 900 dev board, with GY-521 gyro (MPU6050).
